# Forest-Cover-Prediction-
Predict forest cover types using machine learning algorithms on the UCI Covertype dataset. This project uses feature selection and Random Forest classification to classify forest land cover based on environmental and geographic variables. Ideal for beginners learning feature engineering and model evaluation.
